# Shortcuts
A Javascript library that lets you trigger events using keyboard shortcuts.

This library is a rewritten and simplified version of [this library](http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/shortcut.js). I was trying to use the original on an Electron project but ran into a number of problems, so I deconstructed it and wrote my own version. It contains about half the lines of code, and comes wrapped in an [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression).

### Usage Examples
After cloning the library, load __test.html__ in your browser to see a few usage examples.

### Adding Shortcuts

To add a keyboard shortcut use:

    shortcuts.add('ctrl+shift+m',function() {
        myFunction()
    })

In the above example we are assigning the __control shift m__ keys to a function called `myFunction`.

You can optionally pass a DOM element via the third parameter in order to attach a shortcut to a specific object:

    var element = document.getElementById('myid')

    shortcuts.add('ctrl+shift+m',function() {
        myFunction()
    }, element)

### Removing Shortcuts

To remove a keyboard shortcut use:

    shortcuts.remove('ctrl+shift+m')

### Modifier Keys

The following modifier keys are supported:

* cmd (Mac only)
* ctrl
* alt
* shift
